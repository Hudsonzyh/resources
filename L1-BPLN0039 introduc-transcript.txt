So in. Thank you for joining today section for today's this. This evening I will give you the very brief read introduction or at least the piece of patience module. Overall. Dee dee Dee, tonight's the session I would not report. Let's wise briefly introduction two of these the dissertation module really emphasise these the ends of all kinds. We expect the student to achieve opportunities the module and also introduce the assessment. I Karen, because that is very important for all other modules where we first of all have to give your collegiate guidance that what is the assessment period? Just make sure you understand how we assess one. Then the second part I would go through release the timelines overview of the time, not because it's a long process. The module is that broad today. This is the first module in 92 and Dr. September next year not end up this fall some September where you finish your dissertation and make submission. So we'll be around ten months along with this. And so for at least the long process that we will emphasise these, I emphasise this time he timelines and also stressed that these are key submissions. There was submissions asking you to submit different terms. Just be remember all this information is in the guidance documents that I have already post on a small dose, and I spent much earlier this month to ask all of you to read at least one carefully. And I don't know how many of you have read already or not. I hope you have, because this is that tonight is just the overview release guidance we tried to go through. Let us in brief wait if you have and me some more, don't page So you might find a little bit confusing because there are several more Jewish underlies Moodle page entry is the whole school structure where put all dissertation support you in the one platform. Okay like is the setting so for all of use is the bpra0 is usually nice. This is the main module issue we would Kabul for tonight's introduction is a dissertation research module. So where you in a future where you look at the details or documents you are looking for all the videos, all the lectures I post that is all underneath the EP three. Nice one looks really nice. One out of two modules are programs in a coordinated by my colleagues. What a nice we looking for the hundreds of students to us this deal and to join these right because these the module is the design across all the master will waste us in the PSP except the two modules two programs. Why is the masters in Urban design to ACP planning another? Why don't you sustainable urbanism these two programs we have the choice where they would do dissertation research module or Lee would do major research projects. Module four Honours progress Master progression is automatically you would do this dissertation research. So that is the one response to. Okay. And the third part, I would just spend 10 minutes, 15 minutes, see how it goes and just give you kind of the explanation what makes a successful dissertation because I don't want to speak to details we ain't up to. We go through the steps. We will You will have the most clear and distinct today. I just give you some flavour of what makes a good successful dissertation linked. In the end I would like to have some kind to give you opportunity to raise any questions because I really would like you to raise any questions up till you release the documents or the guidance document. This Q&A session. I hope you can bring some questions. It's better to have these the live sessions much easier and also benefit for all of your cohort as well. So don't be afraid to ask the questions and I like you to type any questions in the chat box. Later, we will go through this question one by one each possible. So any question you already have or later, while I'm talking, something is not clear. You keep on show us need to clarify eventually so looking perplexed done this one he might not. Also if you are in the public space later when during the Q&A session, I really want you to unmute yourself. Release the question, if possible, to not your camera. I know it is and you are in a public space, so you might feel difficult or is impossible. You can pack in the chat box. Just see us. To my colleagues range to to raise the question. You just say, no, you can't speak. So later, right when we raised the question about you. Okay, next, the plan. So overall these the module is really is that was the question we were asked is the what it is dissertation. The dissertation is independent the piece of original work and we were looking for you to produce the 10,000 work that original documents. So it was the project is the 60 credit so total of your master program credit is 180 account one third of your degrees. So I don't need to emphasise how important it is. Well example, these terms you have possibly each a four taught module three and each module should account 15. So these dissertations count almost of all modules. So it's really big chunk. Okay. And the dissertation is really is the major impacts piece of work and typically by student of course, or as I said, we want these modules all across all master's program and we really expect to do develop with student's research skills ability and to allow the student to explore in depth in particularly our usually complex areas, in their taught modules, in their master programs or specialised the teaching or sometimes could be in electric module as well. So at least the dissertation represents a study of the specified topics based on needs garrotte analysis of the primary, or sometimes using the secondary data and also engagement with the literature. Existing literature reviews on that topic. Your choice The student with demonstrated ability from design to topics and think about your research question and link to think about is the how you exactly complete your empirical data analysis. He also provided some kind of the critical thinking refraction and particularly focus on the choice of your areas, all the case studies. So this is the the aim of this project, this dissertation is really ask the student to be self organised. This dissertation actually is a student driven exercise. So after listening modules we really expect you to students has been trained, had demonstrated your ability to do these original research because some of the students might think about to do the dissertation. So opportunities to master dissertations training, you'll be able to do that in mind. Establish a address clearly focussed on a fundamental research question and relate it to the theory literature. So this is the kind of relation we have an overview of the modules. I mentioned that in the previous slide, but one of the keys training in this the module is really let the students be able to develop to this ability to conduct research safely in a reflective manner with the shoot belts consideration after this ethical issue and risk assessment and data protection requirement. That is part of our training. Okay. So these aspects that you see these this student led student driven exercise, we were provided battery support. Okay. So the one key part is that you are paying compulsory online mini lectures, which was something the mini like you would be delivered by me and will be pre-recorded today is kind of the one lecture is what it is, makes a good to successful dissertation and then alerts nightly to. I will let you know when it's ready to review. It is all pre-recorded and is compulsory, so make sure you watch it. I think although it is pre-recorded. But what the system we can assess whether you have watched or not late. We have the methodology sections and that would be coordinated by the channel one my colleagues he will responsible to deliver these the 11 methods Section 11 measures questions to cover all where a key of the methods has been used applied in the planning relevant to research lab. Much to colleagues is the program director who is also part of the recent research support team. Li will meet each degrees cohort to discuss how to make the dissertation topics in particular, particularly your master views studies field named by Dr. Jan. So I will leave the program director to to coordinate in each program. And we also have tons of parties from the libraries, just tons. We have the collection up to pass a student dissertation. All these the sample are a good high quality. One is tasty. It's finish this Annapolis dissertation and they they are accessible digitally so you can view lecture easy and or shall we have a look each student had the supervisor so you will have different times meeting with your look at your spacious equation. So what's the role of I need to spend some time explaining you about the role of the supervisor. Each student will make up your. Mind to make this issue. What topics? So you'll propose your topics to your program directors by the 3rd of February next year after the programs there are to have the brief a discussion with you. We have your to direct your ideas. Lend the program director. We are located the supervisor. That but just bear in mind this is supervisors and occasions purely undertaken by the program directors with my involvement to have this coordination across the whole schools. Okay. And the. Because this depends this allocation depends on the topics and availability of the staff. Because since you love me like to have it. Particularly staff to us the supervisor. But sometimes we may be difficult to implement. Please just make sure it's all allocated to supervisors and they have the ability to supervise to support your dissertation post to process. This is when these programs directorate are located this supervisor, they always try to match the research escapees as much as possible at just not always, sometimes due to the best of our abilities. And so in this time extent to which I might have to supervise the transport should progress during that is fine. Although that is not my expertise. I spotted because we all has been trained how to do research, so we are experienced. I think we have this kind of the knowledge of how to do the proper research so we can support you to do the dissertation. And most of this supervisor meetings. We asked all a student, after you've been located your supervisor, please initiate your first. The meeting with the average is each supervisor have 10 minutes each student across the different progress so respected Warner Student Please take this responsibility to initiate all your meetings. Okay. And also Lisa from from Bree Keel and Dr. Jones, I let Connie Dr.. For five months. So you will meet you all at all times. Okay. Just make sure that is kind of the rules for the BZP. We try to be fair to all students, so we set the limit is the maximum is four times the meeting with your supervisor. Okay, so what is the role of the supervisor? So why So we are helping you to think about your research topics and also to your yield. What is the series may be engaging with that topics of your choice and they will help you support you to plan your proposal. The supervisor will give you feedback on your proposal. Okay. Meanwhile, they need to approve your risk assessment and the concurrence as well. So it is wise to also reach your draft workshop, your background chapter. This background chapter. I'll explain to you, including three chapters, Introduction, literature and a methodology. These fellows take your speaker. Muted. You hear me? Hello?

SPEAKER 1
Something comes in.

SPEAKER 0
Yeah. Yeah. And then the surprise also is the mark for your dissertation. Okay. And his second man, he's a teacher will be marked by two markers. Okay. Why is your supervisor Why don't you use the anonymous markers in the end to weigh the two markers to have the discussion when they were agreed to find the one. So an assessment for the dissertation will add two part elements. One is the proposal, as I just mentioned. And then the final one is the dissertation. Final dissertation. The proposal come 10%. So we would like you to direct your proposal. Like what? Limit to source. And what's that? Only a percent at the back to a good quality research proposal is really good for your final dissertation. If finding this kind of the correlation. So we really would like you to think about is how you came up to your proposal. Sorry. And that is really your thought of your next step research. Well, all these the deadline, that proposal submission is to force a problem until you have the meeting with your supervisor. Okay. And the supervisor need to approve your act concurrence and also risk assessment where you do your proposal. Submission. We ask you to clarify. This one has been approved. Lane You were able to propose to submit your proposal? I would not. But like in the mini lectures that we assure you how you would do it. Okay. And the deadline for that proposal submission is for the April 3:00. Notice we all sent the submission, set the submission deadline times 3:00 pm. But now basically change your cereal was changed to 3 p.m. easier in case of some technical issues which students might encounter. They came across administrator to do some recovery with coffee which were looking okay. And the feedbacks everybody will have the same release. Time is the second opt me. So you will have the written feedback. Next lane is the final submission. That is the piece of work consumption. So. During this submission with the fruit dissertation. In the meanwhile, you also need to again to submit these the AP comparisons and also risk assessment again, because sometimes it must change when you're doing the field work. Some of the methodology may change kind of all the different. So we ask you to resubmit expecting and if no change, you can use exactly what you use for the research proposal. Submission. Okay. That nice 4th of September. The feedback is late is usually this time up to we have the exam board because that has to be confirmed by example. So last week we just have the exam board and last for last year's cohort. So you expect next year this time you will have that your result proportional assessment, as I said, 10%. So what element in the proposal? We this is the states element. So how to develop the good proposal. I will organise this mini lectures. So let will be carbo only studied. How could they just give you kind doctor briefly introduction. So one of piece is to think about is the time people and that is really to think about how you progressed your work. And also we ask you to mention all these. The assessment won't need to be proof before your submission and these ethical issues that you need to discuss in a not a separate meaning lectures as well. It just bear in mind proposal we cook you a warning, although it is only count 10%, but you will pay out if you not fully meet these criteria. For example, if you don't submit your ethical courage. So your point will be zero. Okay. Now you have the choice is no choice. You you have recovering and keeping your 28 hours. You can resubmit this material, the parents poems or risk of these true pediment. Okay And name it happens really is the late submission penalty applied in that case? Okay. So that's why I said everyone can think about is the you can do like you reach you have great all these criteria. So we ask you to submit these cookie before. All right. Okay please penalty and also dissertation okay is missing in the dissertation. So Misha, you would not include one so you would be spam in a way or we ask you to recover we submit. Okay. Late submission pen. Keep that as well. So just be aware. Look dissertation assessment assessment lots of the criterias we have to put in our guidance. Nila 14 criteria actually is goes through all these the chapter introduction and the research questions and also literature reviews. We asked you to review some exterior theoretical engagements that you need to demonstrate your critical reading of existing literature and theories. You engage with that one and also clearly defined methodology. And this is the one I didn't mention many times already and length you need to have. The chapter is the empirical. It's the primary data chapter unique. Demonstrate how you collect least one a least analysis, whether it is a property or a reflection, how you discuss your collections, how you interpret your findings in, and you need to make some reflections on this research you have okay need to emphasise what is the contribution, knowledge, contribution and see a contribution overall. We also assessed the restructure, whether it is logically your presentation referencing they so we talked about is the how relevant is these topics are undertaking sometimes is difficult for students. So just make sure the first meeting talk to your voice is very important because topics you need to choose these. The planning related topics. Nice important one. And this is the. Timelines. A very small point. I would expect your concrete details. Okay. I advise you preemies time line to stick on your watch because this structure is in the different stages. It's quite complicated. So it's very easy to mix it. So it's better to put some where we suppose you're. Casey, see, what is the next step you need to do? Okay. So, for example, at first the meetings we advised the student to initiate the meeting with usable ice around each summit, February to March. Lent to discuss your topic. This situation will give you kind of the advice you can think about how you would evaluate the proposal. So the next step, you talked to your supervisor, you already kind of dropped off your proposal. Then you make the decision that you'll make the submission on force of the April named after Y first. So wisely, we give you feedbacks on the second day of the meeting, so we advise you to arrange your third meeting often once you got the feedbacks. Then you discuss the how to implement and what is the next step in a few weeks. Then we ask you to to. Meet your supervisor on last at final meetings usually will arrange between the end of June to June July, because that time we asked you to propose to write, to submit District three chapter as the background chapters to your supervisor. So why do you have to reach these ST chapters and give you. In a world where it all returns feedback and tell you how to improve it. So that is kind of the writing changes. Okay. So that will help you to write define those. Went back to why some will not be able to restore a whole chapter of your dissertation. The only can read your three chapters. Okay. You'll meet most of next one. But ladies, the deadline to submit these three chapters at least at night, not very strict by the wild, is to submit around that time. This will keep you kind up to good feedback as to how to improve your writing. Okay. And then we asked you to submit your final title around Case of August. Because that will help the program director to allocate the second marker who is familiar on the particularly topics of your dissertation to debt markets. So just bear in mind is the dissertation submission. So price there could be some extension I don't need. Under these exceptional circumstance we support evidence. The maximum is two weeks actually our program. Host goose master program tutored Bang Cleaver is here. He will every these count up the exceptional success. Application to be approved by bank. Okay, so Eden will sing her recite extremely a section notes a concise. You paint us the four extra long extension that will be and don't appear deferred till January 24. Your cohort 2020 people that you still be able to meet the graduation. We still hope. The This is not all compulsory online stuff. Mini lectures. I will organise well as I mentioned. These will be the phone. Each question design I need also reteach here. Main methodology core issue named to think about how you analysis a how to make the conclusion into a copyright issue. We asked our colleagues to give you an overview of this issue as well. Okay. And ethics. So the methods, as I mentioned this, where we teach all the matters we will introduce to you so is optional. You can choose the one you related to your topics, or you can choose account all overlaps because they're all pre-recorded. You can choose any time to do yet. Okay. So Lisa contributed by our colleagues. They all have good experience. Experts use these the methodology in their research already. So we see we are still only facing the kind of the global pandemics until some of the city, some of the nations we consider ourself in the UK expecting normal by some of the nations like China. So you have very strict lockdowns in some cities. So we be aware it is kind of a difficulty. So when we do decide our research we need to think about is to allow yourself some stability and kind of the Plan B contingency plans. That is always a place that you might in the worst scenario. Sometimes your case studies have been struggling. That city has been something in lockdown. So we can still think about use the opportunity way to to do the remote research. That is possible because in the past, the previous or most of that was still in time that we were truly remotely and has been produced the good quality of the dissertation. So, so far, not just the last weeks we have, for example, the external exam really praised the quality of the dissertation from last year and some of the research has been very high quality. We should publish that kind of level. For me, I have good experience with my supervises. So we be together and manage to publish the two students dissertation master's student dissertation in the quality of the journal and stop these things. Last week I just published paper in a political geography. That is the good journalist, where also is a collaboration with the Master's student. So we see the board to develop the good master dissertation work even in the beauty needs that pandemic difficult time. Okay. But just bear in mind, too, is to leave your sector. So kind of the press ability to do so, except our BSP support in the schools universities Institute of the Education that is the writing Centre. And also you still have the writing that you can also join that online. It one of the key books. I would recommend you to read by the big banks. One is especially good to exit, which you just follow step by step. Okay. Handbook. Be sure up to you do that. Follow that kind of tips. You will be able to do good to make a successful dissertation. Okay, so now that I will spend 10 minutes, just give you kind of flavour what it is the good dissertation. Okay. The dissertation that I said, this is kind of the academic research. So in academic research we usually category like do five different type of these academics. Research for the same price is equal to have the clear cut, but sometimes they are relate to each other. So like to an empirical studies should be relevant to the theory a This theoretical study useful for empirical application for most of your coursework like the modules you are learning bottom of these essays coursework. Now usually being category three is the empirical studies based on a reinterpretation of artists posts, empirical studies, or the critical review of these existing literature. So let kind of the category in a for a dissertation for an undergraduate and a people. I want you the Ph.D. late in the planning field that you belong to least type one impact to ILA is based on you need some primary data for the interviews the way or historical keep doctor documents or you can use the secondary data to do to the statistics analysis. You don't have to do use the primary data. So sometimes you can use the secondary data from the some people have collected, all from the government online. The percent who can use the okay use the course or dragnet s mapping that kind of new technologies. You can use their second of data. Okay. And because I always said to is that the dissertation we really need to ask you demonstrate originality. I'm not expecting you will produce these kind of the the groundbreaking new theory because what. Our playing field. This subject, possibly the pure series, very difficult to achieve. That would be this professor, if he can do that. Well, Paul, in mathematics, it may be easier to do. You produce these kind of pure series, but for planning dissertation, we really need to see a masters dissertation. We expect the meta level of this demonisation that you demonstrate the contribution to this knowledge with your reaching a patient or into patient of the content. Use your case study as well. So often you see these the planning dissertations have kind of the know much in patients. It's actually more related to social science. You also identify that than proper or you think you post after you've done your empirical studies. Then you propose to some solutions to solve next issue. All right. Improvement. Yeah. So what is the dissipation? Looks that, as I said, go back to library to look only surpassed this example good quality ability station. You may not only read your specific progress disappear she advise you to come across the different progress well, because sometimes they overlap each other. For example, the urbanism sustainable urbanism matters progress. You might find the the good example in the urban regeneration progress these patients cohosh collections where so a dissertation I think some of the students you are undergraduate major is in geography or history or political science social science. So you have familiar these the format of the dissertation myself you'd you are not for new social science you might. Buying is new. For example, the urban architect or some of the student background may be from not on a science background or some other project from the mathematics department. So you assign each new. But just bear in mind this dissertation it is academic research is not extended to simply essay. So the insight happening is kind of to animate essential elements. Right. Introduction to question to analysis. The collection may have the reflection. Let current elements we will go through. Okay the structure of these I edit nearly semi-sheer always I received the inquiry from student to ask them how to what can't what it is include, what is not improved. Okay, so here I put that very clearly to to state which is can get which is not to okay and the 10% used in rule is applied. So although in most of that you move those modules is always we set to what animate depends also to salsa. So you still kept these 10% looking for this module. So it depends on the individual in just tutors. Breathability. Okay. This one is clear. 11,000 maximum. You can conclude that piece of steel, actually, clearly in your cover letter. You'll cover each when you do your final submission. And also in your proposal. These two sources also speak the word in Italy as well. The CEO. And I usually ask what kind of the balance of each chapter's asked me to give kind of the guidance. It's difficult here. I also put just roughly idea. So this is only to give you guidance. Purpose is not like to go. You have to state these kind of 40%. Okay. But just tell you is the important part is your primary catch up to this. That could be wrong. Chapter four These are the case findings. And then you demonstrate how you analysis your interpretation, link, discussion, conclusion. That would be one of the main one. 60% I just propose is kind of subtraction, roughly. It's not. Okay. So these is very detailed. Each chapters. What we expect you to produce. And I would not go through all these the P pass and the Y key point I would like to raise is the key research question. Actually, when you think about your topics, always link with your research question. Okay. To think about these two what it is. Good research question. One piece I always ask the my supervisor. In the first meeting I always ask them to think about is the durable feasibility of your research question whether you can do it. Sometimes this always is not always. Quite few times a student always propose this kind of very ambitious idea. But you need to think about your master dissertation project on your textbook, although not always the ten most actually, when you start to do your empirical data collection is actually from April or May up to your examination. Then you need to finish some make submission. So you probably got four months that kind of the pay scale. So you need to think about feasibility. So whether you can finish, for example, you might propose to to do the interviews. Some students say, okay, I would do the parts to make cut our interview within the main of that city. But you need to think about how you reach length. So all we think about this would be that the first meeting where you talk to your supervisor. When you propose your topics or a project, the methodology need to think about is related to the question. Methods is really serve to answer the question research questions you have raise in the beginning. Okay. So you can choose to differentiate qualitative or qualitative. Or sometimes you can mix. They have the different type. So all these past I need you to meet later. So the the students usually come. Not so difficult to choose which topics, which research questions I have or go to focus for my dissertation. So here I put these two suggestions by the punch one he really. Least the least the six questions. So if you are puzzling to make easy and complicated topics, you are thinking. So I would advise you to go through list the six. Aspect, then you will. I'm sure after you go through the line, you will have the clearly a which one which topics is more suitable for you? Okay. So the primary chapters I search these is the related to your empirical data collection and also analysis discussion. Conclusion. So leave you to reach here. I point out some commonly weakness. Okay. The first one usually say to me, I'll read these too broad. Sentence could be narrowed because sentences relied on particularly the passage. And you need to think about sometimes me whether this dataset is assessable or not. So in cases, sometimes you can't reach that particularly dataset or you can't reach in a particular group to post you'd like to interview. So you need to have these kind of the more broader way to do your research. Okay. So these research questions need to be designed, coherent and really answer trying to see your method, whether you use in your later proposals, whether Lee can answer your research question. Okay. And quite often the students spent lots of time to do their case study, background, background chapters, and not much time to write out in the end about their primary thing. I checked their empirical cases, so you can see the balance of the dissertation is not well balanced. They spent so much effort, those words space ball introduction, patch or background chapters that encourage to finish the dissertation so they how to write the empirical one and you will find sometimes that is not well structured and also the writing style is not appropriate sometimes particularly sorry some of the students because you are consultants you might familiar with the report consultant you use quite a lot when it came to lecturing the writing format. But for academic research we really expect you to see more, at least the Academic Research Committee. So I would like you to read all the journal articles that remain relevant to an article Urban Studies, the planning series or the IDEA International Journal and Regionalist Research. All these helped in environmental planning A, B, C, D, kind of series. After you read these two articles, then you have to say what is kind of the writing style looking? So we as I mentioned, we always need to evaluate, assess your coherence as well. Okay. That is coming up. So, look, finances, right? I mean, it's the what to do next. Guidance. Read the guidance carefully. Okay. Any markdown needs the key. That last calendar that's I mentioned. Put that the high lines. I have produced that to page one in the somewhere easy to assess, to see. Okay. And then that's the question, is it not? You're not clear to you. You can post that in the student forum or you can ask your program director or you can say email to me. Okay. The student performer actually is that kind of that hope is kind of providing this platform to share your understanding. They share your peer group. Learning together is kind of collective one. So if you lost your lunch, not sure you posted it. So I would like to see are still they can response that way and because you have read to some guidance documents clearly speaking the document already I sometimes I also can engage a recently primary inquiry as well. Okay. But if you are not sure, don't be panic yourself. Speak out. Okay. Ask the question. Okay. Name your. The next step is really to think about prepare your ID. You might talk to two assembly staff and your program director or your personal tutor as lam being named. You can think about each the site week topics. You are ready to go quiet it and go to the questions I have suggest that one. Okay, so wait to see you submit your topics ideas in February. Okay. Use that template. I would like it. So I will keep these to 20 minutes to 30 minutes if possible. Name for the Q&A session. So please use this opportunity to ask the question if it's not clear to you. Okay. And as I said, to go to this one today, I'm so glad to thank Clement also joined this section. I ask him to come to help me because this is my first year to coordinate the whole program. These are patient project and Bhengu has done this for many years. He's more experienced. So I ask you to join the training sessions with it. So I might close. Not shabby name you. We can leave you to reach the questions. Don't be shy. Okay. Let me see the Chopped. I'm not good at reading quickly. That's why I was trying to raise the question for me.

SPEAKER 2
So the first question we have says the process as you've laid it out strikes me as very impersonal and mechanised. Other than the four meetings with our supervisors, which I assume are no longer than 45 minutes, are there any other in-person opportunities for individual or even small group interactions? Ideation feedback with UCL academic staff for our projects?

SPEAKER 0
I don't know what sort of. So easily. Okay, let me see. You see, in the first the one I saw, I could go catch clearly. Either the chapters one the. As I mentioned, the former Times meeting with the student, with the supervisor, it up to that mutual convenience. Sounds soft. Like to have the 1 to 1 meeting of the staff that they might do it a virtually zoom meeting. Okay. And each we set four times each meeting. It depends. The first a couple of meetings could be shorter because you talk about topics and your talk about proposals. So you usually spent like kind of 20 such minutes named after that search is really discuss your proposal for the next will work and then the your finding analysis next will be long. So you might looking for kind up to 25 minutes to one hour sometimes but maximum I think each time equal is for one, not less. So that's why I like the students. Okay. The cohort, your programs, as I mentioned, program directors will organise a small cohort, particularly for each individual progress. And it is up to program directors arrangement. They might have the warning that December they have the next one in January or some of the programs or actually might have the 1 to 1 weeks to select. So it's all up to the individually program director arrangement. Okay. But if the student only can learn each other. So any fee you might come up to, not very sure. You might post that in a student performance name. Many each other. A pyramid is the most effective way. I was just.

SPEAKER 3
Going to add to that one. Thank you. I mean, the. Thing about the four meetings is that it's meant to be a student led piece of work, so it's not meant to be a piece of work. The staff are essentially guiding students to the extent that it's almost a member starts work, it's going to be the student's work and it's student led. So that's why there's this sort of meeting limit. In our experience, four is more than enough to to provide the guidance that's appropriate for a student led project. The other thing to know is the reason for having that guidance there is also about fairness. Because if you had some students having eight meetings and others having three with the same supervisors, that that probably would be quite unfair. So I don't think it's sort of mechanised. I think it's the process allows us to have fairness across a cohort of 320 students who take this dissertation.

SPEAKER 0
You. One of the questions asked of.

SPEAKER 2
So there's a follow up question to this one. Curious on what the protocol is. If you want to talk to and receive light feedback on your research ideas from a professor who isn't your supervisor but might be more specialised for your topic.

SPEAKER 0
I mean, yes, you can't approach Let's stop by sanctions. Just bear in mind that our colleagues are very busy. So is the Warren Terrace help? So you need to approach really nicely in a way, or you'll find a way to for example, you might have the discussion engagement with that professor during this kind of seminar or at an event like that with sections that kind of the informal occasion. Then you can discuss with them all. You can say email to not particularly stock. So it's all up to that. But they don't have an obligation have to to, to response. Okay. Just bear in mind because your supervisor who will have the obligation to meet you or to ask your project but any idea that why don't you more interim basis that's my do well my understanding is that correct bank.

SPEAKER 3
Yeah, absolutely. And people often do speak to someone else on their supervisor. And if it's close to someone's research interests, I'm sure they're usually happy to have a discussion.

SPEAKER 0
I would say to alcoholics Apprendre usually I received the email. Now I, I always try to helpful in me to provide to my advice if possible. So. So don't feel like she has status. You still get. Ask that. Okay. And also your personal tutor is very useful as well. So you can use that. Make most of your personal to me pink you to me teens they discuss your particularly when you back to your topics ideas. That kind of stage is very special to have the conversation with a person that you to.

SPEAKER 2
Someone had their hand up, the hand went down. But if if you want to put your hand up and ask the question, you don't have to put it in the chat. You can also say it out loud. The next question is can we write on a purely historical topic?

SPEAKER 0
Yes, you can. Nice. Because I suppose I pass this by these who have been there and study in history. So he has done research on transport planning in London. So all the material he uses are key metabolic methods in, in his dissertation. That is the spatial planning progress storage. Remember some has produced a good dissertation shall not repeat away. So you don't have to use I mean, collect a memory data by yourself. Sometimes you can use the secondary data, but you depends on the data set to availability. Okay. Next, we went. Well.

SPEAKER 2
The next question is, is there funding available to AIDS in collecting primary data?

SPEAKER 0
Nope. Nope. Because this is a self student driven exercise. Okay. So you have to initiate that to travel to this case study site of your interest. So we don't have that kind of support unless that project is related to the. To read, particularly research project for example. My what might be it depends because I'm doing a Yasi project. I works in the Chinese cities, so the students doing that, I might I don't know, I might integrate that with less research. I would not advise you to seek the funding support from. The staff. Particularly for your guys. And usually this is the same treatment. This is the exercise they all show is kind of your training program, training process.

SPEAKER 2
Thank you. Thank you. The next question says, In my undergraduate studies, we were not able to reuse any work written in the proposal in our dissertation. Is that something you still implement?

SPEAKER 0
Okay. Yeah. In the in the honours module, for example, you have written essays, for example, pale findings, essays that kind of essays materials. You're not allowed to use that in isolation, but to support a dissertation, the whole structure of this module, the research proposal entries part of the progress for that final dissertation. So a lot still to use the material because that it covered the literature, the carbon objectives, and also measures the use of some case studies justification as well. So all this material can be used to focus on the dissertations final part. So let us not be count us the self prejudice. Okay. Only one. We do not use that in our proposed material.

SPEAKER 2
Thank you. The next question is about supervisors. How are supervisors chosen? Can we make suggestions? And who else about supervisors can be based on our topic?

SPEAKER 0
Okay. As I mentioned, let one a supervisors location is purely a location undertaking by the each program director. Also consult with me and also head the school. So all the program direction they are located that your supervisor is they would try to match your topics. Okay. So almost quite certain they will. But just on exceptional cases, they might not be able to find the availability of that staff. Well, examples. My research expertise on a Chinese city smartphone that you can see so many Chinese students. So I can't say why so many Chinese students. So we might have to locate it. But for all US supervisors, we have a located to your project. We are confident they have these abilities, the skills to to do research. So for your exercise, that is really how to do this dissertation. So they will guide you through. And we have lots of that not only supervisors support but also fond of my one compulsory for many lectures that is different every chapters including in your piece of patients to find a dissertation we all covered called expert already so in this from different colleagues. So you've got lots expertise on that topics all the methods lectures.

SPEAKER 2
Uh, there's one more question. Since the compulsory and optional sessions, if I heard correctly, are pre-recorded videos, how can we ask questions about them and discuss key issues? Well, we have opportunities to talk through issues and questions with the faculty leading those sessions in Lifetime.

SPEAKER 0
Okay. Mm hmm. That's quite cheeky, because in the last year, we organised the live section. What? You and me were actually not mainly student turnout. That's why this year I haven't organised. So I will leave that open if there is that demand. Have the left night section queuing. So I will organise this one. Okay. I'll coordinate with the programme director if there is a need. But then in the alternative way is to propose your research question or your, your kind of the SO two or something. Not in the student forum. Student forum. Use the platform as a discussion. Okay. So try to make most of it.

SPEAKER 2
I think we've gone through all the questions, so maybe we allow a couple more minutes if anyone wants to ask another question.

SPEAKER 0
Okay. Maybe you might do some advertisement of my own seminar series because I'm running the China Planning Research Seminar series. Seminar series to really help your is more research led that kind of the topics so we I would really encourage the student who we are takes some research project about the Chinese cities to kind to join the sending us okay that will help you to do these this series is existing debate okay let's send with you what usually is a divide pace in peace event. For example, a coming. Why is the 23rd? I asked. The invited speaker from Princeton University talked about the justice Justice, the planning, and particularly related to the amount of planning in Chinese cities.

SPEAKER 2
I say if you've got your hand up.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, Sorry. I just want to follow that. The question that I asked about how to raise questions and discuss issues that are coming up from the sessions. I didn't really understand your answer. You seemed to say that last year there was a forum to do that, but there wasn't enough demand for it. And so this year there is you got rid of it and you said that we should sort of express our demand. And if there is enough of it, you might organise that. I'm just wondering how specifically to do that. Like, should we be emailing you questions and you're just sort of telling them up to see if there's enough demand or how do we go about doing that?

SPEAKER 0
Okay. I think you can post your search in a student forum. Okay. Name it, ladies. Good. Kind of to questions. We might organise the one to have the discussion. Nice section, but today's one. Okay.

SPEAKER 1
So post them on moodle.

SPEAKER 0
That's what you're saying and not moodle student. On the move is the one section course student forum. Okay then. And this is still far raised, the kind of dirt provided it perhaps long for the students to peer learning. So it's kind of the debate format if I could pursue. So I'd really encourage you to post any sort of question. Yeah. Okay.

SPEAKER 2
There's a couple of more questions in the chat now. Is it possible to build upon and further develop our undergraduate dissertation?

SPEAKER 0
Yes. Yes. It depends on the topics of your choice. I think you can carry on to do a large. I would not have to. Objection on that. What's your advice be?

SPEAKER 3
Yeah, it has to be a new piece of work. So it may be that it's the same topic. It may be that if you did an undergraduate dissertation, one of your conclusions was around further research that's needed on this topic. And if you then want to go and do that new research, then that sounds good to me if it's relevant. So our courses here, it's just making sure, I suppose, that there is a new piece of work. You're not just going to plagiarise by copying and pasting bits from your undergraduate dissertation, but a sort of continuation of the same topic you're already aware of and interested in. That's okay.

SPEAKER 0
Yeah. So, yeah, I advise you to because in the past we have this still use their undergraduate dissertation, but they use the empirical data that is that was collected before your master progressed that. So may I advise them not to do that because you have to demonstrate your new data collection at least. Yeah. So you can carry on that topics. No problem. But you need demonstrate to this new stuff that. Okay. And why is the prejudice the percentage. And did think he is not that kind of a what I would say like 20 25% you just be careful to have looks if are in similarity result come out 20 25%. You have looked each house where it is and just make sure you stick it properly. For example, you say that the direct material from a particularly articles you use the direct quotations mark is sometimes I always encourage your students try to avoid to use too many direct quote. That is the lazy way to say and try to rephrase that and to present your understanding on that kind of the readings and materials kind of to demonstrate your abilities, the critical thinking analytics, analytical schemes as well. So that's my suggestion. Avoid to use too much the right one direct quotation. Although the some of the key concept you can use a direct quotation is more powerful in to wait. Okay, These.

SPEAKER 2
Are the questions.

SPEAKER 0
Tried to use this opportunity to ask the questions because these also again. Don't be afraid. Because honestly, what answer might have the similar question? Just be too shy. So you raised the question for me. If not, I might have to close. Today's session. Okay. One more call. One, two, three. Okay. Kitchen. Thank you. Let's finish today's session. Okay. If you have any questions. As I sent home slacking student foreign or send email. And also your programs that write to us as well. Mean we will coordinate with all the different programs being tried to organise ladies that you might have the live session that today we might have two small groups. So we are help. We are here always try to help as much as possible. Okay. Okay. Thank you very much for your coming today and maintains Bay and stands ready to help me. Okay. Bye bye, everyone.

SPEAKER 2
Thanks. Bye.
